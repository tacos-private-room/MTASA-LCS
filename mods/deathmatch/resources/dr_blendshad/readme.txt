Description:
Vehicle and traffic light textures are drawn slightly above world surfaces. 
What this simple resource does is pick light texture and multiply with underlying 
surface pixel color instead of just adding to it. A simple way to make the lights look
less 'milky' and more appealing even in darker areas. 

This requires dr_rendertarget resource. Also works with dr_image3dlight, dr_material3dlight, dr_primitive3dlight
