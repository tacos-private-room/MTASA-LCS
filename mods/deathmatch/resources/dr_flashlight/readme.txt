Description:
All you need is to start the resource and you will see the explanation on how to use 
it in the chatbox. The shader projects a light effect on nearby world, vehicle and ped textures. 
It uses exported functions of dr_lightmanager and dr_rendertarget resources.

The original flashlight model from:
http://www.sharecg.com/v/29667/related/5/3D-Model/Flashlight-model+texture
Slightly modified and converted.

You will be needing bone_attach resource - so place it along with flashlight
resource in resources folder. Also You will need dr_rendertarget and dr_lightmanager 
resources as well.
