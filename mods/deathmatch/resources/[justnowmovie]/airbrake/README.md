# Airbrake documentation

Airbrake is a small resource which lets you fly around easily without obstacles being able to block your way. I did not make it for gameplay, but for editing stuff, like making paths using NPC HLC traffic editor.

## Using Airbrake
Airbrake is controlled using numpad keys. It only works when you are on foot. Airbrake controls:
* Num0: toggle airbrake mode
* Num2, Num8: move back and forward
* Num4, Num6: move left and right
* Num-, Num+: move down and up
* Num7: speed up the movement
* Num9: slow down the movement
